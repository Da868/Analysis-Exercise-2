# Analysis-Exercise-2


Utilizing datasets/axisdata file.
I computed...

1. Average cars sold per month
2. Max cars sold per month
3. Min cars sold per month
4. Average cars sold per month by gender
5. Average hours worked by people selling more than
three cars per month
6. Average years of experience
7. Average years of experience for people selling more
than three cars per month
8. Average cars sold per month sorted by whether they
have had sales training
What do you think is the best indicator of whether someone is a good
salesperson?

In light of my analysis, I was able to conclude successful car salesmen who sold greater than three cars per month worked 35 hours or more per week on average. Additionally, I discovered car salesmen with sales training were able to slightly outperform the average car sold  by .25. translating into a 6 percent increase in the teams monthly closing average. Moreover, the employees records together with the 40 records visuals computed due to keep realistic standards on a dealership. I noticed men slightly worked more on average, and slightly outnumberd women in sales on average. Lastly, I would conclude a good salesmen would ensure to work no less then 35 hours per week, complete sales training, and would consistantly outperform the monthly sales average of 3.92 cars sold per month.
